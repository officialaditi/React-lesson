1) in HTML we give class to and tag and with the help of it we will style the component to do this in react we have to write className in (camelCase)

2) className because in javascript class is an reserved word we can't use that to define the class to our tag so we will name as className in camelCase only

3) we can use 1 component multiple time and it will display the same the time we call it

4) for styling we have style in index.css file which is root file to style we have different method to style the component

==> in this folder we made an card component and style it and repeat that card component 4 time.
