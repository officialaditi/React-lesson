1) React is an Js Library used for build the ui of the website

2) React are made out of components.

3) Component:- components are the js function that accept the props and return the jsx. 
components can be as small as button and as large as entire page.
react components are javascript function that return markup (jsx);
we can nest the component inside another component.
component name should always be in captial letter

4) JSX:- Javascript syntax extension or js xml which allow us to write HTML markup inside js code

5) to write js inside the component we have to use curly braces {} so we can now use js inside the return statement of the component for normal js code we can write above the return statement.

==> everything in the theory is show inside the examples.
