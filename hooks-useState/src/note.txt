1) Hooks = Hooks are the special feature that allow functional components to use React feature without writing the class components

useState:- 
1) it's an react hook that let us add state variable to your components.
example:-
const [state, setState] = useState(initialStatevalue);
// we have used (array destructuring) and destructured the state and setState 
 
>>>>>>>>>>>>>> initialState:-
1) the value we want the start variable should have at the start
example:- state = 0 or state = true 
// for the initial stage.

2) it can be a value of any type (number, bool, array, string etc);

3) this argument is ignored after the initial render.

4) if we pass the (initialStatevalue) it will be treated as initializer function.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> what Return
1) useState Return an array with exactly two values:
   ---> the current state.
   during the 1st render it will match with the initial value we have passed
   ---> the (set) function that let us update the state to different value and trigger a re-render

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> set function :-
                setSomething(nextState)

1) the (set) function returned by useState and let us update the state to a different value and trigger re-render of the components

2) we can give next state value direactly or function that calculate it from previous value.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>> nextState:-
1) it an value that we want to be an state after change.

>>>>>>>>>>>>> Return 
            set function do not have a return value.

############# Example:-
import { useState } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);
  const [name, setName] = useState('Taylor');
  return (
    <>
    <h1>hooks</h1>
    </>
  )
}
export default MyComponent;

===> currentState (age) of this state variable, initially set to initial state value we provided 
example:- age = 42(initialValue)

===> setFunction (setAge) allow us to change it to any other value in response to interaction.

===> initialState ( 42) the intial value of age variable.

1) to update the UI, we will call the (set) function with next State:-
   function handleClick() {
    setName('aditi')
   }

react will store the nextState value and whenever the handleClick() function run it will update the initial value with new which is (aditi); and update the UI
