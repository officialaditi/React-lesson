Updating array in state...

1) array are mutable(can change) in js, but we should treat them as immutable(can't change) when we store it on state.

2) whenever we want to update the array stored inside the state we have to create the new one or ( make a copy of an exist one with(...spread operator))

3) after that set the state to use the new array

updating array without mutation:-

1) use (concat, [...spread]) for adding 

2) use (filter, slice) for removing

3) use (map) for replacing or looping

4) use (reverse, sort) for sorting but first copy the array

Adding a array :-

 ==> create a new array which will contain existing items and a new item at the end

 ==> we can this by simply using (...spread operator) ...(what we wanna spread)

 ==> don't just direactly update the array put it inside the update function and use it

 ==> don't use the same name as state variable just take the 1st letter of the paramter and name it and spread that letter or variable to update and add


 remove an array :-
 
 ==> use the filter method to remove and array

 ==> _(underscore) using this as parameter means the parameter is being passed to function is being ignored
